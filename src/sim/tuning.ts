/**
 * Shot speeds are high enough that bolts barely curve at close range: over a
 * distance D a bolt at speed v sags about g D^2 / (2 v^2) and Coriolis bends
 * it up to omega D^2 / v. At 80 m/s that is ~0.1 m + 0.4 m over 10 m on the
 * standard ring; across the ring it still curves a lot.
 *
 * Weapon stats. Field meanings (see WeaponStats in types.ts):
 *   muzzle        bolt speed relative to the shooter (m/s)
 *   damage        health damage per hit; shieldDamage = damage to shields
 *   interval      seconds between shots
 *   heatPerShot   0..1 of the heat bar per shot (0 = never overheats; 1 = overheats every shot)
 *   coolRate      heat bar per second when not firing
 *   overheatLock  seconds you're locked out after overheating
 *   radius        bolt size (m), lifetime = how long a bolt lives (s)
 *   magSize       rounds per magazine; ammoMax = spare rounds you can carry (0 = no ammo, heat only)
 *   reloadTime    seconds to reload (R, or automatic when the magazine is empty)
 *   knockback     kick a hit gives an 80 kg player (m/s), along the bolt's path
 *   chargeTime    pistol overcharge / Laconic Laser charge time (s)
 *   burstTime     Laconic Laser: how long the stream lasts once charged (s)
 *   oc*           the pistol's overcharged shot
 *   blast*        explosion on impact (fuel rod)
 *   chargeMoveScale / chargeLookScale  Laconic Laser: movement and aim speed while charging and firing
 *   thrust, burnTime  rockets: constant push (m/s^2) along the rocket's nose for burnTime s. The nose
 *                 starts where you aim (not along the launch velocity) and keeps its direction
 *                 relative to the stars, so in the ring's frame it slowly turns against the spin.
 *   turnRate, seekRange, seekAngle  homing: how fast the nose can turn (rad/s) toward the nearest
 *                 enemy within seekRange and seekAngle degrees of the nose
 *   pellets, spread  scattergun: shots per pull, scattered within `spread` degrees of your aim
 *   muzzleMin     >0: every shot's speed is random between muzzleMin and muzzle
